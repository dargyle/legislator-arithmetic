\noindent  \section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

We propose a neural network implementation of ideal-point estimation
that scales well to large datasets and allows incorporation of
additional metadata. Neural networks are well-suited for these models,
and the performance benefit, along with distributed computing
capabilities, allows application of ideal point estimation to pooled
datasets where computation was previously infeasible due to scale. We
demonstrate the algorithm on two different datasets, the complete
history of US Congressional roll call votes and modern cosponsorship
networks, and compare the results against standard ideal point
estimation techniques.

To evaluate algorithmic performance, we test the resulting estimates on
both training and test data by holding out a subset of legislators'
votes. This allows us to compare the quality of different model
parameterizations and choice of dimensions while still guarding against
overfitting. Specifically, we directly compare the performance of
different ideal point parameterizations such as DW-NOMINATE and the
conventional Bayesian parameterization.

We demonstrate the algorithms in two ways. First, we jointly estimate
ideal points over the pooled set of US Congressional roll call votes
from 1789-2018. Unidimensional ideal points from the neural network
implementation are similar to the conventional DW-NOMINATE results.
However, cross validation scores indicate that the data are better
explained with more than one dimension. Clustering the multidimensional
ideal points yields intuitive temporal and ideological groupings and
provides a more nuanced picture of ideological polarization.

Second, we take advantage of the fact that many more bills are sponsored
than actually come to a vote and estimate an ideal point distribution
over a large set of sponsorship and cosponsorship decisions in the
93rd-114th Congresses. Cosponsorship provides a different perspective on
legislators' beliefs, independent of strategic voting or administrative
votes of little ideological salience. We treat cosponsorship as a clear
endorsement of a bill's content and assume that a choice not to
cosponsor a bill can be interpreted as something less than full support.
When compared to traditional ideal points, cosponsorship ideal points
show somewhat different trends in polarization and result in a higher
number of optimal dimensions.

\section{Existing methods}\label{existing-methods}

{[}This is polmeth, y'all know this already{]}

This work is inspired by two, highly similar, lines of research in
political science and computer science. Speaking generally\footnote{A
  complete review of the literature in either field is beyond the scope
  of this work.{]}} , political scientists--from the days of (really old
cite), through Poole and Rosenthal, and up to and including modern
contributions such as (modern cites)--have focused primarily on ideal
point estimation as a means to study the ideology space implied by the
ideal points themselves. That these methods also predict votes is
somewhat of an afterthought. On the other hand, computer science
implementations largely focus on predicting legislator votes, without
concern regarding the ideal points themselves.

Combining the insights of these two fields, we wish to have the most
predictive power without overfitting. We can then interpret the most
predictive ideal points for insights.

We suggest that 1. the model that predicts the best \emph{on a held out
sample of votes} provides the most insight into ideal points and 2. that
there is a clear tradeoff between explanatory power and ease of
interpretation of ideal point models that should be expliit.\footnote{We
  will provide evidence that the optimal number of dimesnions for ideal
  point estimation is larger than most common one or two. It is
  perfectly reasonable to choose to rely on two dimensions, but the
  tradeoffs of that choice should be clear.} We implement ideal point
models in a neural network framework because it's easily extensible and
transparent. Our results suggest that the two dimensional model relied
on sacrifices explanatory power in voting decisions.

\section{Technical Details}\label{technical-details}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{model} 

}

\caption{\label{fig:model1}Base Model}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}
\end{figure}

We rely on several simple techniques from machine learning 1. Out of
sample testing 2. Dropout regularization

Out of sample testing provides clear insight about the impact of a
decision. Does it make sense to add another dimension? How much do
dynamic ideal points help?

Dropout in two places: 1. Each dimension to ensure fitting even if first
dimensions dominates. 2. On bill embeddings (to not overfit to a
specific bill). Why not on legislators? The structure of the dynamic
part of the model doesn't allow this easily.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{My method and WNOMINATE packages are
similar}\label{my-method-and-wnominate-packages-are-similar}

\subsection{Let's do some things that weren't really feasible
before}\label{lets-do-some-things-that-werent-really-feasible-before}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  I implemented DW-NOMINATE as a neural network

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Why? Because I could! But also because it's a nice platform for this
    kind of optimization.
  \item
    It scales much better than existing implementations
  \item
    It's extensible in very interesting ways
  \end{itemize}
\item
  All ideal point models are (a bit) overfit.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    At some point the algorithm starts to make marginal improvements to
    the parameters that don't improve out of sample performance
  \item
    Out of sample performance matters much more than in sample (e.g.~if
    we only cared about in sample we'd just add dimensions until we cam
    predict it perfectly)
  \item
    Out of sample performance is a useful metric for evaluating modeling
    choices (adding another dimension, adding a time component, adding
    an external variable)
  \end{itemize}
